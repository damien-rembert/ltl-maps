## What is this?

This was made to display locations on a map.
It was a good excuse to try working with Gatsby and Leaflet.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Get a csv.**

    Get csv file, call it `postcodes.csv` and put it in `src/data`
    It should have the following columns:

    ```csv
    Count_sum,postcode,latitude,longitude
    ```

2.  **Get the dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm i
    ```

3.  **Run it!**

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```
